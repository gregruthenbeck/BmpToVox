# bmp2vox
A C++ command-line utility that converts a stack of images into a cube-lattice. Works for very large datasets. Output is either ascii or binary indexed nodes.

This tool was used to perform biomechanical simulations on the microstructure of bone at very high resolution. See: <https://ruthenbeck.io/projects/biomechanical-simulation>
